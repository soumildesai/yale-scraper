# Yale Student Facebook Scraper

## Overview
This project uses **Selenium** and **Beautiful Soup** to scrape Yaleâ€™s online student directory (after manual CAS login).  
The scraper collects structured data from each student card, including:

- Name  
- College  
- Class year  
- Address  
- Major  
- Birthday  
- Photo URL  

All results are exported to a CSV file (`students.csv`) with clear headers for further analysis.

4. Run the scraper
